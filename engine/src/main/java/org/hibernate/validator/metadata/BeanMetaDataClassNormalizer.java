/**
 * Define how the validated class is normalized before being used as the key to get the bean metadata.
 * <p>
 * In the case of the predefined scope validator factory, we have to register all the classes that will ever be
 * validated. To validate method calls, frameworks usually generate proxies to intercept the calls. Such proxies might
 * be hard to register in the predefined scope validator factory as they are generated code.
 * <p>
 * This contract allows to normalize the class before obtaining the metadata from the
 * {@code PredefinedScopeBeanMetaDataManager} so that we only have to register the original bean class and not the proxy
 * class.
 * <p>
 * Apart from avoiding the need to register the class, it also avoids generating unnecessary metadata for the proxy
 * classes.
