/**
 * This class defines the dynamic group sequence provider contract.
 * <p>
 * In order to redefine dynamically the default group sequence for a type T, the {@link GroupSequenceProvider} annotation
 * must be placed on T, specifying as its value a concrete implementation of {@code DefaultGroupSequenceProvider}, which
 * must be parametrized with the type T.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If during the validation process the {@code Default} group is validated for T, the actual validated instance
 * is passed to the {@code DefaultGroupSequenceProvider} to determine the default group sequence.

 * Note:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implementations must provide a public default constructor.</li>
 * <li>Implementations must be thread-safe.</li>
