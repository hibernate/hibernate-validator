== Further reading

Last but not least, a few pointers to further information.

A great source for examples is the Bean Validation TCK which is available for anonymous access on
https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck/[GitHub]. In particular the TCK's
https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck/tree/master/tests[tests] might be
of interest. http://beanvalidation.org/latest-draft/spec/[The JSR 380] specification itself
is also a great way to deepen your understanding of Bean Validation resp. Hibernate Validator.

If you have any further questions to Hibernate Validator or want to share some of your use cases
have a look at the http://community.jboss.org/en/hibernate/validator[Hibernate Validator
Wiki] and the https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=9[Hibernate Validator Forum].

In case you would like to report a bug use
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HV/[Hibernate's Jira] instance.
Feedback is always welcome!
