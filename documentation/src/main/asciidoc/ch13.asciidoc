== Further reading

Last but not least, a few pointers to further information.

A great source for examples is the Bean Validation TCK which is available for anonymous access on
link:$$https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck$$[GitHub]. In particular the TCK's
link:$$https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck/tree/1.1.0.Final/tests$$[tests] might be
of interest. link:$$http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/spec/1.1.0.cr3$$[The JSR 349] specification itself
is also a great way to deepen your understanding of Bean Validation resp. Hibernate Validator.

If you have any further questions to Hibernate Validator or want to share some of your use cases
have a look at the link:$$http://community.jboss.org/en/hibernate/validator$$[Hibernate Validator
Wiki] and the link:$$https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=9$$[Hibernate Validator Forum].

In case you would like to report a bug use
link:$$http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HV$$[Hibernate's Jira] instance.
Feedback is always welcome!
