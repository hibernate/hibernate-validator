== Declaring and validating bean constraints

In this chapter you will learn how to declare (see <<section-declaring-bean-constraints>>) and
validate (see <<section-validating-bean-constraints>>) bean constraints.
<<section-builtin-constraints>> provides an overview of all built-in constraints coming with
Hibernate Validator.

If you are interested in applying constraints to method parameters and return values, refer to
<<chapter-method-constraints>>.

[[section-declaring-bean-constraints]]
=== Declaring bean constraints

Constraints in Bean Validation are expressed via Java annotations. In this section you will learn
how to enhance an object model with these annotations. There are the following three types of bean
constraints:

* field constraints
* property constraints
* class constraints

[NOTE]
====
Not all constraints can be placed on all of these levels. In fact, none of the default constraints
defined by Bean Validation can be placed at class level. The `java.lang.annotation.Target` annotation
in the constraint annotation itself determines on which elements a constraint can be placed. See
<<validator-customconstraints>> for more information.
====

==== Field-level constraints

Constraints can be expressed by annotating a field of a class. <<example-field-level>> shows a field
level configuration example:

.Field-level constraints
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/fieldlevel/Car.java[tags=include]
----
====

When using field-level constraints field access strategy is used to access the value to be
validated. This means the validation engine directly accesses the instance variable and does not
invoke the property accessor method even if such an accessor exists.

Constraints can be applied to fields of any access type (public, private etc.). Constraints on
static fields are not supported, though.

[TIP]
====
When validating byte code enhanced objects property level constraints should be used, because the
byte code enhancing library won't be able to determine a field access via reflection.
====

==== Property-level constraints

If your model class adheres to the
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/spec-136004.html[JavaBeans] standard, it
is also possible to annotate the properties of a bean class instead of its fields.
<<example-property-level>> uses the same entity as in <<example-field-level>>, however, property level
constraints are used.

.Property-level constraints
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/propertylevel/Car.java[tags=include]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The property's getter method has to be annotated, not its setter. That way also read-only properties
can be constrained which have no setter method.
====

When using property level constraints property access strategy is used to access the value to be
validated, i.e. the validation engine accesses the state via the property accessor method.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to stick either to field _or_ property annotations within one class. It is not
recommended to annotate a field _and_ the accompanying getter method as this would cause the field
to be validated twice.
====

[[type-arguments-constraints]]
==== Type argument constraints

Starting from Java 8, it is possible to specify constraints directly on the type argument of a
parameterized type. This requires that `ElementType.TYPE_USE` is specified via `@Target`
in the constraint definition. As of Bean Validation 2.0, built-in Bean Validation as well as
Hibernate Validator specific constraints specify `ElementType.TYPE_USE` and can be used
directly in this context.

Hibernate Validator validates type arguments constraints specified on collections, map values,
`java.util.Optional`, and custom parameterized types.

===== With `Iterable`

When applying constraints on an `Iterable` type argument, Hibernate Validator will validate each
element. <<example-type-arguments-constraints-collections>> shows an example of a
`List` with a type argument constraint.

In this example, `@ValidPart` is a custom constraint allowed to be used in the `TYPE_USE` context.

===== With `Map`

Type argument constraints are also validated for map values. Constraints on the key are ignored.
<<example-type-arguments-constraints-map>> shows an example of a `Map` value with a type
argument constraint.

----
====


===== With `java.util.Optional`

When applying a constraint on the type argument of `Optional`, Hibernate Validator will automatically
unwrap the type and validate the internal value. <<example-type-arguments-constraints-optional>> shows
an example of an `Optional` with a type argument constraint.

----
====


===== With custom parameterized types

Type arguments constraints can with two restrictions also be used with custom types. First, a
`ValidatedValueUnwrapper` must be registered for the custom type allowing to retrieve
the value to validate (see <<section-value-handling>>). Second, only types with one type arguments
are supported. Parameterized types with two or more type arguments are not checked for type argument
constraints. This limitation might change in future versions.

<<example-type-arguments-constraints-custom-parameterized-type>> shows an example of a custom
parameterized type with a type argument constraint.

[[validator-usingvalidator-classlevel]]
==== Class-level constraints

Last but not least, a constraint can also be placed on the class level. In this case not a single
property is subject of the validation but the complete object. Class-level constraints are useful if
the validation depends on a correlation between several properties of an object.

The Car class in <<example-class-level>> has the two attributes `seatCount` and `passengers` and it
should be ensured that the list of passengers has not more entries than seats are available. For
that purpose the `@ValidPassengerCount` constraint is added on the class level. The validator of that
constraint has access to the complete `Car` object, allowing to compare the numbers of seats and
passengers.

Refer to <<section-class-level-constraints>> to learn in detail how to implement this custom
constraint.

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/classlevel/Car.java[tags=include]

[[section-constraint-inheritance]]
==== Constraint inheritance

When a class implements an interface or extends another class, all constraint annotations declared
on the super-type apply in the same manner as the constraints specified on the class itself. To make
things clearer let's have a look at the following example:

.Constraint inheritance
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/inheritance/Car.java[tags=include]
----

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/inheritance/RentalCar.java[tags=include]
----
====

Here the class `RentalCar` is a subclass of `Car` and adds the property `rentalStation`. If an instance of
`RentalCar` is validated, not only the `@NotNull` constraint on `rentalStation` is evaluated, but also the
constraint on `manufacturer` from the parent class.

The same would be true, if `Car` was not a superclass but an interface implemented by `RentalCar`.

Constraint annotations are aggregated if methods are overridden. So if `RentalCar` overrode the
`getManufacturer()` method from `Car`, any constraints annotated at the overriding method would be
evaluated in addition to the `@NotNull` constraint from the superclass.

[[section-object-graph-validation]]
==== Object graphs

The Bean Validation API does not only allow to validate single class instances but also complete
object graphs (cascaded validation). To do so, just annotate a field or property representing a
reference to another object with `@Valid` as demonstrated in <<example-cascaded-validation>>.

[[example-cascaded-validation]]
.Cascaded validation
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/objectgraph/Car.java[tags=include]
----

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/objectgraph/Person.java[tags=include]
----
====

If an instance of `Car` is validated, the referenced `Person` object will be validated as well, as the
`driver` field is annotated with `@Valid`. Therefore the validation of a `Car` will fail if the `name` field
of the referenced `Person` instance is `null`.

The validation of object graphs is recursive, i.e. if a reference marked for cascaded validation
points to an object which itself has properties annotated with `@Valid`, these references will be
followed up by the validation engine as well. The validation engine will ensure that no infinite
loops occur during cascaded validation, for example if two objects hold references to each other.

Note that `null` values are getting ignored during cascaded validation.

Object graph validation also works for collection-typed fields. That means any attributes that


* are arrays
* implement `java.lang.Iterable` (especially `Collection`, `List` and `Set`)
* implement `java.util.Map`

can be annotated with `@Valid`, which will cause each contained element to be validated, when the
parent object is validated.

[[example-cascaded-validation-list]]

====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/objectgraph/list/Car.java[tags=include]
----
====

So when validating an instance of the `Car` class shown in <<example-cascaded-validation-list>>, a
`ConstraintViolation` will be created, if any of the `Person` objects contained in the passengers list
has a `null` name.

[[section-validating-bean-constraints]]
=== Validating bean constraints

The `Validator` interface is the most important object in Bean Validation. The next section shows how
to obtain an `Validator` instance. Afterwards you'll learn how to use the different methods of the
`Validator` interface.

[[section-obtaining-validator]]
==== Obtaining a `Validator` instance

The first step towards validating an entity instance is to get hold of a `Validator` instance. The
road to this instance leads via the `Validation` class and a `ValidatorFactory`. The easiest way is to
use the static method `Validation#buildDefaultValidatorFactory()`:

.`Validation#buildDefaultValidatorFactory()`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter02/validation/ValidationTest.java[tags=setUpValidator]
----
====

This bootstraps a validator in the default configuration. Refer to <<chapter-bootstrapping>> to
learn more about the different bootstrapping methods and how to obtain a specifically configured
`Validator` instance.

==== Validator methods

The `Validator` interface contains three methods that can be used to either validate entire entities
or just single properties of the entity.

All three methods return a `Set<ConstraintViolation>`. The set is empty, if the validation succeeds.
Otherwise a `ConstraintViolation` instance is added for each violated constraint.

All the validation methods have a var-args parameter which can be used to specify, which validation
groups shall be considered when performing the validation. If the parameter is not specified the
default validation group (`javax.validation.groups.Default`) is used. The topic of validation groups
is discussed in detail in <<chapter-groups>>.

===== `Validator#validate()`

Use the `validate()` method to perform validation of all constraints of a given bean.
<<example-validator-validate>> shows the validation of an instance of the `Car` class from
<<example-property-level>> which fails to satisfy the `@NotNull` constraint on the `manufacturer`
property. The validation call therefore returns one `ConstraintViolation` object.

[[example-validator-validate]]

===== `Validator#validateProperty()`

With help of the `validateProperty()` you can validate a single named property of a given object. The
property name is the JavaBeans property name.

===== `Validator#validateValue()`

By using the `validateValue()` method you can check whether a single property of a given class can be
validated successfully, if the property had the specified value:

[NOTE]
====
`@Valid` is not honored by `validateProperty()` or `validateValue()`.
====


`Validator#validateProperty()` is for example used in the integration of Bean Validation into JSF 2
(see <<section-presentation-layer>>) to perform a validation of the values entered into a form
before they are propagated to the model.

[[section-constraint-violation-methods]]

==== `ConstraintViolation` methods

Now it is time to have a closer look at what a `ConstraintViolation` is.
Using the different methods of `ConstraintViolation` a lot of useful information about the cause of the validation failure can be determined.
The following gives an overview of these methods.
The values under "Example" column refer to <<example-validator-validate>>.

`getMessage()`:: The interpolated error message
	Example::: "may not be null"
`getMessageTemplate()`:: The non-interpolated error message
	Example::: "{... NotNull.message}"
`getRootBean()`:: The root bean being validated
	Example::: car
`getRootBeanClass()`:: The class of the root bean being validated
	Example::: `Car.class`
`getLeafBean()`:: If a bean constraint, the bean instance the constraint is
             applied on; if a property constraint, the bean instance hosting
             the property the constraint is applied on
	Example::: `car`
`getPropertyPath()`:: The property path to the validated value from root bean
	Example::: contains one node with kind `PROPERTY` and name "manufacturer"
`getInvalidValue()`:: The value failing to pass the constraint
	Example::: `null`
`getConstraintDescriptor()`:: Constraint metadata reported to fail
	Example::: descriptor for `@NotNull`

[[section-builtin-constraints]]
=== Built-in constraints

Hibernate Validator comprises a basic set of commonly used constraints. These are foremost the
constraints defined by the Bean Validation specification (see <<validator-defineconstraints-spec>>).
Additionally, Hibernate Validator provides useful custom constraints (see
<<validator-defineconstraints-hv-constraints>>).

[[validator-defineconstraints-spec]]
==== Bean Validation constraints

Below you can find a list of all constraints specified in the Bean Validation API.
All these constraints apply to the field/property level, there are no class-level constraints defined in the Bean Validation specification.
If you are using the Hibernate object-relational mapper, some of the constraints are taken into account when creating the DDL for your model (see "Hibernate metadata impact").

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Validator allows some constraints to be applied to more data types than required by the
Bean Validation specification (e.g. `@Max` can be applied to strings). Relying on this feature can
impact portability of your application between Bean Validation providers.

[NOTE]
====
On top of the parameters listed above each constraint has the parameters

====

[[validator-defineconstraints-hv-constraints]]
==== Additional constraints

In addition to the constraints defined by the Bean Validation API Hibernate Validator provides several useful custom constraints which are listed below.
With one exception also these constraints apply to the field/property level, only `@ScriptAssert` is a class-level constraint.

`@CreditCardNumber(ignoreNonDigitCharacters=)`:: Checks that the annotated character sequence passes the Luhn checksum test. Note, this validation aims to check for user mistakes, not credit card validity! See also http://www.merriampark.com/anatomycc.htm[Anatomy of Credit Card Numbers]. `ignoreNonDigitCharacters` allows to ignore non digit characters. The default is `false`.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@Currency(value=)`:: Checks that the currency unit of the annotated `javax.money.MonetaryAmount` is part of the specified currency units.
	Supported data types::: any sub-type of `javax.money.MonetaryAmount` (if the https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=354[JSR 354 API] and an implementation is on the class path)
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@DurationMax(days=, hours=, minutes=, seconds=, millis=, nanos=, inclusive=)`:: Checks that annotated `java.time.Duration` element is not greater than the one constructed from annotation parameters. Equality is allowed if `inclusive` flag is set to `true`.
	Supported data types::: `java.time.Duration`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@DurationMin(days=, hours=, minutes=, seconds=, millis=, nanos=, inclusive=)`:: Checks that annotated `java.time.Duration` element is not less than the one constructed from annotation parameters. Equality is allowed if `inclusive` flag is set to `true`.
	Supported data types::: `java.time.Duration`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@EAN`:: Checks that the annotated character sequence is a valid link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number_%28EAN%29$$[EAN] barcode. type determines the type of barcode. The default is EAN-13.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@Email`:: Checks whether the specified character sequence is a valid email address. The optional parameters `regexp` and `flags` allow to specify an additional regular expression (including regular expression flags) which the email must match.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@Length(min=, max=)`:: Validates that the annotated character sequence is between `min` and `max` included
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: Column length will be set to max

`@LuhnCheck(startIndex= , endIndex=, checkDigitIndex=, ignoreNonDigitCharacters=)`:: Checks that the digits within the annotated character sequence pass the Luhn checksum algorithm (see also link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm$$[Luhn algorithm]). `startIndex` and `endIndex` allow to only run the algorithm on the specified sub-string. `checkDigitIndex` allows to use an arbitrary digit within the character sequence as the check digit. If not specified it is assumed that the check digit is part of the specified range. Last but not least, `ignoreNonDigitCharacters` allows to ignore non digit characters.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@Mod10Check(multiplier=, weight=, startIndex=, endIndex=, checkDigitIndex=, ignoreNonDigitCharacters=)`:: Checks that the digits within the annotated character sequence pass the generic mod 10 checksum algorithm. `multiplier` determines the multiplier for odd numbers (defaults to 3), `weight` the weight for even numbers (defaults to 1). `startIndex` and `endIndex` allow to only run the algorithm on the specified sub-string. `checkDigitIndex` allows to use an arbitrary digit within the character sequence as the check digit. If not specified it is assumed that the check digit is part of the specified range. Last but not least, `ignoreNonDigitCharacters` allows to ignore non digit characters.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@Mod11Check(threshold=, startIndex=, endIndex=, checkDigitIndex=, ignoreNonDigitCharacters=, treatCheck10As=, treatCheck11As=)`:: Checks that the digits within the annotated character sequence pass the mod 11 checksum algorithm. `threshold` specifies the threshold for the mod11 multiplier growth; if no value is specified the multiplier will grow indefinitely. `treatCheck10As` and `treatCheck11As` specify the check digits to be used when the mod 11 checksum equals 10 or 11, respectively. Default to X and 0, respectively. `startIndex`, `endIndex` `checkDigitIndex` and `ignoreNonDigitCharacters` carry the same semantics as in `@Mod10Check`.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@NotBlank`:: Checks that the annotated character sequence is not null and the trimmed length is greater than 0. The difference to `@NotEmpty` is that this constraint can only be applied on strings and that trailing white-spaces are ignored.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@NotEmpty`:: Checks whether the annotated element is not null nor empty
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`, `Collection`, `Map` and arrays
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@Range(min=, max=)`:: Checks whether the annotated value lies between (inclusive) the specified minimum and maximum
	Supported data types::: `BigDecimal`, `BigInteger`, `CharSequence`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` and the respective wrappers of the primitive types
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@SafeHtml(whitelistType= , additionalTags=, additionalTagsWithAttributes=)`:: Checks whether the annotated value contains potentially malicious fragments such as `<script/>`. In order to use this constraint, the link:$$http://jsoup.org/$$[jsoup] library must be part of the class path. With the `whitelistType` attribute a predefined whitelist type can be chosen which can be refined via `additionalTags` or `additionalTagsWithAttributes`. The former allows to add tags without any attributes, whereas the latter allows to specify tags and optionally allowed attributes using the annotation `@SafeHtml.Tag`.
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@ScriptAssert(lang=, script=, alias=, reportOn=)`:: Checks whether the given script can successfully be evaluated against the annotated element. In order to use this constraint, an implementation of the Java Scripting API as defined by JSR 223 ("Scripting for the Java^TM^ Platform") must be a part of the class path. The expressions to be evaluated can be written in any scripting or expression language, for which a JSR 223 compatible engine can be found in the class path. Even though this is a class-level constraint, one can use the `reportOn` attribute to report a constraint violation on a specific property rather than the whole object.
	Supported data types::: Any type
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

`@URL(protocol=, host=, port=, regexp=, flags=)`:: Checks if the annotated character sequence is a valid URL according to RFC2396. If any of the optional parameters `protocol`, `host` or `port` are specified, the corresponding URL fragments must match the specified values. The optional parameters `regexp` and `flags` allow to specify an additional regular expression (including regular expression flags) which the URL must match. Per default this constraint used the `java.net.URL` constructor to verify whether a given string represents a valid URL. A regular expression based version is also available - `RegexpURLValidator` - which can be configured via XML (see <<section-mapping-xml-constraints>>) or the programmatic API (see <<section-programmatic-constraint-definition>>).
	Supported data types::: `CharSequence`
	Hibernate metadata impact::: None

===== Country specific constraints

Hibernate Validator offers also some country specific constraints, e.g. for the validation of social
security numbers.
