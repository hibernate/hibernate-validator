== Getting started

This chapter will show you how to get started with Hibernate Validator, the reference implementation (RI) of Bean Validation. For the following quick-start you need:

* A JDK >= 6
* http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven]
* An Internet connection (Maven has to download all required libraries)

[[validator-gettingstarted-createproject]]
=== Project set up

In order to use Hibernate Validator within a Maven project, simply add the following dependency to
your __pom.xml__:

.Hibernate Validator Maven dependency
====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>{hvVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----
====

This transitively pulls in the dependency to the Bean Validation API
(++javax.validation:validation-api:{bvVersion}++).

[[validator-gettingstarted-uel]]
==== Unified EL

Hibernate Validator requires an implementation of the Unified Expression Language
(http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=341[JSR 341]) for evaluating dynamic expressions in constraint
violation messages (see <<section-message-interpolation>>). When your application runs in a Java EE
container such as JBoss AS, an EL implementation is already provided by the container. In a Java SE
environment, however, you have to add an implementation as dependency to your POM file. For instance
you can add the following two dependencies to use the JSR 341 http://uel.java.net/[reference
implementation]:

.Maven dependencies for Unified EL reference implementation
====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.el</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.el-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.4</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.el</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.4</version>
</dependency>

[[section-getting-started-cdi]]
==== CDI

Bean Validation defines integration points with CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java ^TM^
EE, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346[JSR 346]). If your application runs in an
environment which does not provide this integration out of the box, you may use the Hibernate
Validator CDI portable extension by adding the following Maven dependency to your POM:

.Hibernate Validator CDI portable extension Maven dependency
====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator-cdi</artifactId>
    <version>{hvVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----
====

Note that adding this dependency is usually not required for applications running on a Java EE
application server. You can learn more about the integration of Bean Validation and CDI in
<<section-integration-with-cdi>>.

=== Applying constraints

Lets dive directly into an example to see how to apply constraints.

[[example-class-car]]
.Class Car annotated with constraints
====
[source, JAVA]
----
package org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter01;

import javax.validation.constraints.Min;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import javax.validation.constraints.Size;

public class Car {

    @NotNull
    private String manufacturer;

    @NotNull
    @Size(min = 2, max = 14)
    private String licensePlate;

    @Min(2)
    private int seatCount;

    public Car(String manufacturer, String licencePlate, int seatCount) {
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        this.licensePlate = licencePlate;
        this.seatCount = seatCount;
    }

    //getters and setters ...
}
----
====

The@NotNull, @Size and @Min annotations are used to declare the constraints which should be applied
to the fields of a Car instance:


*  manufacturer must never be +null+
*  licensePlate must never be +null+ and must be between 2 and 14 characters long
*  seatCount must be at least 2

[TIP]
====
You can find the complete source code of all examples used in this reference guide in the Hibernate
Validator
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/tree/master/documentation/src/test[source repository]
on GitHub.

=== Validating constraints

To perform a validation of these constraints, you use a Validator instance. Let's have a look at a
unit test forCar:

.Class CarTest showing validation examples
====
[source, JAVA]
----
package org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter01;

import java.util.Set;
import javax.validation.ConstraintViolation;
import javax.validation.Validation;
import javax.validation.Validator;
import javax.validation.ValidatorFactory;

import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class CarTest {

    private static Validator validator;

    @BeforeClass
    public static void setUpValidator() {
        ValidatorFactory factory = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory();
        validator = factory.getValidator();
    }

    @Test
    public void manufacturerIsNull() {
        Car car = new Car( null, "DD-AB-123", 4 );

        Set<ConstraintViolation<Car>> constraintViolations =
                validator.validate( car );

        assertEquals( 1, constraintViolations.size() );
        assertEquals( "may not be null", constraintViolations.iterator().next().getMessage() );
    }

    @Test
    public void licensePlateTooShort() {
        Car car = new Car( "Morris", "D", 4 );

        Set<ConstraintViolation<Car>> constraintViolations =
                validator.validate( car );

        assertEquals( 1, constraintViolations.size() );
        assertEquals(
                "size must be between 2 and 14",
                constraintViolations.iterator().next().getMessage()
        );
    }

    @Test
    public void seatCountTooLow() {
        Car car = new Car( "Morris", "DD-AB-123", 1 );

        Set<ConstraintViolation<Car>> constraintViolations =
                validator.validate( car );

        assertEquals( 1, constraintViolations.size() );
        assertEquals(
                "must be greater than or equal to 2",
                constraintViolations.iterator().next().getMessage()
        );
    }

    @Test
    public void carIsValid() {
        Car car = new Car( "Morris", "DD-AB-123", 2 );

        Set<ConstraintViolation<Car>> constraintViolations =
                validator.validate( car );

        assertEquals( 0, constraintViolations.size() );
    }
}
----
====

In the setUp() method a Validator object is retrieved from the ValidatorFactory. A Validator
instance is thread-safe and may be reused multiple times. It thus can safely be stored in a static
field and be used in the test methods to validate the different Car instances.

The validate() method returns a set of ConstraintViolation instances, which you can iterate over in
order to see which validation errors occurred. The first three test methods show some expected
constraint violations:


* The @NotNull constraint on manufacturer is violated in manufacturerIsNull()
* The @Size constraint on licensePlate is violated in licensePlateTooShort()
* The @Min constraint on seatCount is violated in seatCountTooLow()

If the object validates successfully, validate() returns an empty set as you can see in carIsValid().

Note that only classes from the package javax.validation are used. These are provided from the Bean
Validation API. No classes from Hibernate Validator are directly referenced, resulting in portable
code.
