[[validator-gettingstarted]]
== Getting started

This chapter will show you how to get started with Hibernate Validator, the reference implementation (RI) of Bean Validation. For the following quick-start you need:

* A JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven]
* An Internet connection (Maven has to download all required libraries)

[[validator-gettingstarted-createproject]]
=== Project set up

In order to use Hibernate Validator within a Maven project, simply add the following dependency to
your __pom.xml__:

.Hibernate Validator Maven dependency
====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>{hvVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----
====

This transitively pulls in the dependency to the Bean Validation API
(`javax.validation:validation-api:{bvVersion}`).

[[validator-gettingstarted-uel]]
==== Unified EL

Hibernate Validator requires an implementation of the Unified Expression Language
(http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=341[JSR 341]) for evaluating dynamic expressions in constraint
violation messages (see <<section-message-interpolation>>). When your application runs in a Java EE
container such as JBoss AS, an EL implementation is already provided by the container. In a Java SE
environment, however, you have to add an implementation as dependency to your POM file. For instance
you can add the following dependency to use the JSR 341 https://javaee.github.io/uel-ri/[reference
implementation]:

.Maven dependencies for Unified EL reference implementation
====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.el</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1-b08</version>
</dependency>
----
====

[TIP]
====
For environments where one cannot provide a EL implementation Hibernate Validator is offering a
<<non-el-message-interpolator>>. However, the use of this interpolator
is not Bean Validation specification compliant.
====

[[section-getting-started-cdi]]
==== CDI

Bean Validation defines integration points with CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java ^TM^
EE, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346[JSR 346]). If your application runs in an
environment which does not provide this integration out of the box, you may use the Hibernate
Validator CDI portable extension by adding the following Maven dependency to your POM:

.Hibernate Validator CDI portable extension Maven dependency
====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator-cdi</artifactId>
    <version>{hvVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----
====

Note that adding this dependency is usually not required for applications running on a Java EE
application server. You can learn more about the integration of Bean Validation and CDI in
<<section-integration-with-cdi>>.

[[section-getting-started-security-manager]]
==== Running with a security manager

Hibernate Validator supports running with a {javaTechnotesBaseUrl}/guides/security/index.html[security manager] being enabled.
To do so, you must assign several permissions to the code bases of Hibernate Validator, the Bean Validation API and the code base calling Bean Validation.
The following shows how to do this via a {javaTechnotesBaseUrl}/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html[policy file] as processed by the Java default policy implementation:

.Policy file for using Hibernate Validator with a security manager
====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
grant codeBase "file:path/to/hibernate-validator-{hvVersion}.jar" {
    permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers";
    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "setContextClassLoader";

    permission org.hibernate.validator.HibernateValidatorPermission "accessPrivateMembers";

    // Only needed when working with XML descriptors (validation.xml or XML constraint mappings)
    permission java.util.PropertyPermission "mapAnyUriToUri", "read";
};

grant codeBase "file:path/to/validation-api-{bvVersion}.jar" {
    permission java.io.FilePermission "path/to/hibernate-validator-{hvVersion}.jar", "read";
};

grant codeBase "file:path/to/validation-caller-x.y.z.jar" {
    permission org.hibernate.validator.HibernateValidatorPermission "accessPrivateMembers";
};

==== Updating Hibernate Validator in WildFly

The http://wildfly.org/[WildFly application server] contains Hibernate Validator out of the box.
In order to update the server modules for Bean Validation API and Hibernate Validator to the latest and greatest, the patch mechanism of WildFly can be used.

You can download the patch file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator[SourceForge] or from Maven Central using the following dependency:

.Maven dependency for WildFly {wildflyNextVersion} patch file
====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator-modules</artifactId>
    <version>{hvVersion}</version>
    <classifier>wildfly-{wildflyNextVersion}-patch</classifier>
    <type>zip</type>
</dependency>
----
====

We also provide a patch for the previous version of WildFly:

.Maven dependency for WildFly {wildflyVersion} patch file
====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator-modules</artifactId>
    <version>{hvVersion}</version>
    <classifier>wildfly-{wildflyVersion}-patch</classifier>
    <type>zip</type>
</dependency>
----
====

Having downloaded the patch file, you can apply it to WildFly by running this command:

.Applying the WildFly patch
====
[source]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh patch apply hibernate-validator-modules-{hvVersion}-wildfly-{wildflyNextVersion}-patch.zip
----
====

In case you want to undo the patch and go back to the version of Hibernate Validator originally coming with the server, run the following command:

.Rolling back the WildFly patch
====
[source]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh patch rollback --reset-configuration=true
----
====

You can learn more about the WildFly patching infrastructure in general https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/SingleInstallationPatching/[here] and http://www.mastertheboss.com/jboss-server/jboss-configuration/managing-wildfly-and-eap-patches[here].

[[validator-gettingstarted-java9]]
==== Running on Java 9

As of Hibernate Validator {hvVersion}, support for Java 9 and the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) is experimental.
There are no JPMS module descriptors provided yet, but Hibernate Validator is usable as automatic modules.

These are the module names as declared using the `Automatic-Module-Name` header:

* Bean Validation API: `java.validation`
* Hibernate Validator core: `org.hibernate.validator`
* Hibernate Validator CDI extension: `org.hibernate.validator.cdi`
* Hibernate Validator test utilities: `org.hibernate.validator.testutils`
* Hibernate Validator annotation processor: `org.hibernate.validator.annotationprocessor`

These module names are preliminary and may be changed when providing real module descriptors in a future release.

When using Bean Validation XML descriptors (_META-INF/validation.xml_ and/or constraint mapping files), the `java.xml.bind` module must be enabled.
Do so by appending `--add-modules java.xml.bind` to your _java_ invocation.

[WARNING]
====
When using Hibernate Validator with CDI, be careful to not enable the `java.xml.ws.annotation` module of the JDK.
This module contains a subset of the JSR 250 API ("Commons Annotations"), but some annotations such as `javax.annotation.Priority` are missing.
This causes the method validation interceptor of Hibernate Validator to not be registered, i.e. method validation won't work.

Instead, add the full JSR 250 API to the unnamed module (i.e. the classpath), e.g. by pulling in the _javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api_ dependency
(there already is a transitive dependency to the JSR 250 API when depending on _org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator-cdi_).

If you need to enable the `java.xml.ws.annotation` module for some reason, you should patch it with the contents of the full API
by appending `--patch-module java.xml.ws.annotation=/path/to/complete-jsr250-api.jar` to your _java_ invocation.

[[validator-gettingstarted-createmodel]]
=== Applying constraints

Let's dive directly into an example to see how to apply constraints.

[[example-class-car]]
.Class Car annotated with constraints
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter01/Car.java[]
----
====

The `@NotNull`, `@Size` and `@Min` annotations are used to declare the constraints which should be applied
to the fields of a Car instance:


*  `manufacturer` must never be `null`
*  `licensePlate` must never be `null` and must be between 2 and 14 characters long
*  `seatCount` must be at least 2

[TIP]
====
You can find the complete source code of all examples used in this reference guide in the Hibernate
Validator
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/tree/master/documentation/src/test[source repository]
on GitHub.
====

=== Validating constraints

To perform a validation of these constraints, you use a `Validator` instance. Let's have a look at a
unit test for `Car`:

.Class CarTest showing validation examples
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter01/CarTest.java[]
----
====

In the `setUp()` method a `Validator` object is retrieved from the `ValidatorFactory`. A `Validator`
instance is thread-safe and may be reused multiple times. It thus can safely be stored in a static
field and be used in the test methods to validate the different `Car` instances.

The `validate()` method returns a set of `ConstraintViolation` instances, which you can iterate over in
order to see which validation errors occurred. The first three test methods show some expected
constraint violations:


* The `@NotNull` constraint on `manufacturer` is violated in `manufacturerIsNull()`
* The `@Size` constraint on `licensePlate` is violated in `licensePlateTooShort()`
* The `@Min` constraint on `seatCount` is violated in `seatCountTooLow()`

If the object validates successfully, `validate()` returns an empty set as you can see in `carIsValid()`.

Note that only classes from the package `javax.validation` are used. These are provided from the Bean
Validation API. No classes from Hibernate Validator are directly referenced, resulting in portable
code.
