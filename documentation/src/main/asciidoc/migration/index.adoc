[[introduction]]
== [[_introduction]] Introduction

The aim of this guide is to assist you migrating an existing application using any version `{hvVersionPreviousShort}.x`
of Hibernate Validator to the latest of the `{hvVersionShort}.x` series.

NOTE: If you think something is missing or something does not work, please link:https://hibernate.org/community[contact us].

If you're looking to migrate from an earlier version, you should migrate step-by-step, from one minor version to the next,
following the migration guide of link:https://hibernate.org/validator/documentation/migrate/[each version].

[WARNING]
====
As this release includes significant changes to the processed bean tracking, path implementation and related areas,
we encourage users to give it a try and report any findings, especially if there are non-trivial validation scenarios.

so do not rely on these being immutable in your traversable resolvers.
The `Path` and `Node` representations within the `ConstraintViolation` remains immutable.
