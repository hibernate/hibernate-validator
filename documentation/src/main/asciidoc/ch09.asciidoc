== Bootstrapping

In <<section-obtaining-validator>>, you already saw one way of creating a `Validator` instance - via
`Validation#buildDefaultValidatorFactory()`. In this chapter, you will learn how to use the other
methods in `javax.validation.Validation` in order to bootstrap specifically configured validators.

[[section-retrieving-validator-factory-validator]]
=== Retrieving `ValidatorFactory` and `Validator`

You obtain a `Validator` by retrieving a `ValidatorFactory` via one of the static methods on
`javax.validation.Validation` and calling `getValidator()` on the factory instance.

<<example-build-default-validator-factory>> shows how to obtain a validator from the default
validator factory:

[TIP]
====
The generated `ValidatorFactory` and `Validator` instances are thread-safe and can be cached. As
Hibernate Validator uses the factory as context for caching constraint metadata it is recommended to
work with one factory instance within an application.
====

Bean Validation supports working with several providers such as Hibernate Validator within one
application. If more than one provider is present on the classpath, it is not guaranteed which one
is chosen when creating a factory via `buildDefaultValidatorFactory()`.

In this case, you can explicitly specify the provider to use via `Validation#byProvider()`, passing the
provider's `ValidationProvider` class as shown in <<example-using-specific-provider>>.

Note that the configuration object returned by `configure()` allows to specifically customize the
factory before calling `buildValidatorFactory()`. The available options are discussed later in this
chapter.

Similarly you can retrieve the default validator factory for configuration which is demonstrated in
<<example-configuring-default-provider>>.

[NOTE]
====
If a `ValidatorFactory` instance is no longer in use, it should be disposed by calling
`ValidatorFactory#close()`. This will free any resources possibly allocated by the factory.
====

[[section-validation-provider-resolver]]
==== `ValidationProviderResolver`

By default, available Bean Validation providers are discovered using the
{javaTechnotesBaseUrl}/guides/jar/jar.html#Service_Provider[Java
Service Provider] mechanism.

For that purpose, each provider includes the file _META-
INF/services/javax.validation.spi.ValidationProvider_, containing the fully qualified classname of
its `ValidationProvider` implementation. In the case of Hibernate Validator, this is
`org.hibernate.validator.HibernateValidator`.

Depending on your environment and its classloading specifics, provider discovery via the Java's
service loader mechanism might not work. In this case, you can plug in a custom
`ValidationProviderResolver` implementation which performs the provider retrieval. An example is OSGi,
where you could implement a provider resolver which uses OSGi services for provider discovery.

To use a custom provider resolver, pass it via `providerResolver()` as shown in
<<example-using-custom-validation-provider-resolver>>.

[[section-configuring-validator-factory]]
=== Configuring a `ValidatorFactory`

By default, validator factories retrieved from `Validation` and any validators they create are
configured as per the XML descriptor _META-INF/validation.xml_ (see <<chapter-xml-configuration>>),
if present.

If you want to disable the XML based configuration, you can do so by invoking
`Configuration#ignoreXmlConfiguration()`.

The different values of the XML configuration can be accessed via
`Configuration#getBootstrapConfiguration()`. This can for instance be helpful if you want to integrate
Bean Validation into a managed environment and want to create managed instances of the objects
configured via XML.

Using the fluent configuration API, you can override one or more of the settings when bootstrapping
the factory. The following sections show how to make use of the different options. Note that the
`Configuration` class exposes the default implementations of the different extension points which can
be useful if you want to use these as delegates for your custom implementations.

[[section-validator-factory-message-interpolator]]
==== `MessageInterpolator`

Message interpolators are used by the validation engine to create user readable error messages from
constraint message descriptors.

In case the default message interpolation algorithm described in <<chapter-message-interpolation>>
is not sufficient for your needs, you can pass in your own implementation of the `MessageInterpolator`
interface via `Configuration#messageInterpolator()` as shown in
<<example-using-custom-message-interpolator>>.

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter09/BootstrappingTest.java[tags=messageInterpolator]
----

==== `TraversableResolver`

In some cases the validation engine should not access the state of a bean property. The most obvious
example for that is a lazily loaded property or association of a JPA entity. Validating this lazy
property or association would mean that its state would have to be accessed, triggering a load from
the database.

Which properties can be accessed and which ones not is controlled by querying the
`TraversableResolver` interface. <<example-using-custom-traversable-resolver>> shows how to use a
custom traversable resolver implementation.

[[example-using-custom-traversable-resolver]]
.Using a custom `TraversableResolver`

----

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter09/BootstrappingTest.java[tags=traversableResolver]
----
====

If no specific traversable resolver has been configured, the default behavior is to consider all properties as reachable and cascadable.
When using Hibernate Validator together with a JPA 2 provider such as Hibernate ORM, only those properties will be considered reachable
which already have been loaded by the persistence provider and all properties will be considered cascadable.

==== `ConstraintValidatorFactory`

`ConstraintValidatorFactory` is the extension point for customizing how constraint validators are
instantiated and released.

The default `ConstraintValidatorFactory` provided by Hibernate Validator requires a public no-arg
constructor to instantiate `ConstraintValidator` instances (see <<section-constraint-validator>>).
Using a custom `ConstraintValidatorFactory` offers for example the possibility to use dependency
injection in constraint validator implementations.

To configure a custom constraint validator factory call `Configuration#constraintValidatorFactory()`
(see <<example-using-custom-constraint-validator-factory>>.

====

[WARNING]
====
Any constraint implementations relying on `ConstraintValidatorFactory` behaviors specific to an
implementation (dependency injection, no no-arg constructor and so on) are not considered portable.
====

[NOTE]
====
`ConstraintValidatorFactory` implementations should not cache validator instances as the state of each
instance can be altered in the `initialize()` method.
====

[[section-parameter-name-provider]]
==== `ParameterNameProvider`

In case a method or constructor parameter constraint is violated, the `ParameterNameProvider`
interface is used to retrieve the parameter name and make it available to the user via the
property path of the constraint violation.

The default implementation returns parameter names as obtained through the Java reflection API.
If you compile your sources using the `-parameters` compiler flag, the actual parameter names as
in the source code will be returned. Otherwise synthetic names in the form of `arg0`, `arg1` etc.
will be used.

To use a custom parameter name provider either pass an instance of
the provider during bootstrapping as shown in <<example-using-custom-parameter-name-provider>>,
or specify the fully qualified class name of the provider as value for
the `<parameter-name-provider>` element in the _META-INF/validation.xml_ file
(see <<section-configuration-validation-xml>>). This is demonstrated in
<<example-using-custom-parameter-name-provider>>.

[TIP]
====
Hibernate Validator comes with a custom `ParameterNameProvider` implementation based on the
link:https://github.com/paul-hammant/paranamer/[ParaNamer] library which provides several ways
for obtaining parameter names at runtime. Refer to <<section-paranamer-parameternameprovider>>
to learn more about this specific implementation.
====

[[section-clock-provider]]
==== `ClockProvider`

For time related validation (`@Past` and `@Future` constraints for instance), it might be useful to define what is
considered `now`.

This is especially important when you want to test your constraints in a reliable manner.

The reference time is defined by the `ClockProvider` contract. The responsibility of the `ClockProvider` is to
provide a `java.time.Clock` defining `now` for time related validators.

----

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter09/BootstrappingTest.java[tags=clockProvider]
----
====

Alternatively, you can specify the fully-qualified classname of a `ClockProvider` implementation using the
`<clock-provider>` element when configuring the default validator factory via _META-INF/validation.xml_
(see <<chapter-xml-configuration>>).

[NOTE]
====
When validating `@Future` and `@Past` constraints, you might want to obtain the current time.

You can obtain the `ClockProvider` in your validators by calling the
`ConstraintValidatorContext#getClockProvider()` method.

For instance, this might be useful if you want to replace the default message of the `@Future`
constraint with a more explicit one.

[[section-bootstrapping-valueextractors]]
==== Registering ``ValueExtractor``s

As mentioned in <<chapter-valueextraction>>, additional value extractors can be registered during bootstrapping
(see <<section-valueextraction-registeringvalueextractor>> for the other ways to register a value extractor).

<<example-registering-value-extractor>> shows how we would register the value extractors we previously created
to extract the keys and the values of Guava's `Multimap`.

==== Adding mapping streams

As discussed earlier, you can configure the constraints applied to your Java beans using XML based
constraint mappings.

Besides the mapping files specified in _META-INF/validation.xml_, you can add further mappings via
`Configuration#addMapping()` (see <<example-adding-mapping-streams>>). Note that the passed input
stream(s) must adhere to the XML schema for constraint mappings presented in
<<section-mapping-xml-constraints>>.

You should close any passed input stream after the validator factory has been created.

[[section-provider-specific-settings]]
==== Provider-specific settings

Via the configuration object returned by `Validation#byProvider()`, provider specific options can be
configured.

In the case of Hibernate Validator, this e.g. allows you to enable the fail fast mode and pass one or
more programmatic constraint mappings as demonstrated in
<<example-hibernate-validator-specific-options>>.

Alternatively, provider-specific options can be passed via `Configuration#addProperty()`. Hibernate
Validator supports enabling the fail fast mode that way, too:

mode and the constraint declaration API.

[[section-configuring-validator]]
=== Configuring a Validator

When working with a configured validator factory it can occasionally be required to apply a
different configuration to a single `Validator` instance. <<example-using-context>> shows how this can
be achieved by calling `ValidatorFactory#usingContext()`.
