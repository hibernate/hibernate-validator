[[validator-customconstraints]]
== Creating custom constraints

The Bean Validation API defines a whole set of standard constraint annotations such as `@NotNull`,
`@Size` etc. In cases where these built-in constraints are not sufficient, you can easily create
custom constraints tailored to your specific validation requirements.

[[validator-customconstraints-simple]]
=== Creating a simple constraint

To create a custom constraint, the following three steps are required:

* Create a constraint annotation
* Implement a validator
* Define a default error message

[[validator-customconstraints-constraintannotation]]
==== The constraint annotation

This section shows how to write a constraint annotation which can be used to ensure that a given
string is either completely upper case or lower case. Later on, this constraint will be applied to
the `licensePlate` field of the `Car` class from <<validator-gettingstarted>> to ensure that
the field is always an upper-case string.

The first thing needed is a way to express the two case modes. While you could use `String` constants,
a better approach is using an enum for that purpose:

.Enum `CaseMode` to express upper vs. lower case

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/CaseMode.java[]
----
====

The next step is to define the actual constraint annotation. If you've never designed an annotation
before, this may look a bit scary, but actually it's not that hard:

[[example-defining-custom-constraint]]
.Defining the `@CheckCase` constraint annotation
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/CheckCase.java[tags=include]
----
====

An annotation type is defined using the `@interface` keyword. All attributes of an annotation type are
declared in a method-like manner. The specification of the Bean Validation API demands, that any
constraint annotation defines:

* an attribute `message` that returns the default key for creating error messages in case the
constraint is violated

* an attribute `groups` that allows the specification of validation groups, to which this constraint
belongs (see <<chapter-groups>>). This must default to an empty array of type Class<?>.

* an attribute `payload` that can be used by clients of the Bean Validation API to assign custom
payload objects to a constraint. This attribute is not used by the API itself. An example for a
custom payload could be the definition of a severity:
+
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/payload/Severity.java[tags=include]
----

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/payload/ContactDetails.java[tags=include]
----
====
+
Now a client can after the validation of a `ContactDetails` instance access the severity of a
constraint using `ConstraintViolation.getConstraintDescriptor().getPayload()` and adjust its behavior
depending on the severity.

Besides these three mandatory attributes there is another one, `value`, allowing for the required case
mode to be specified. The name `value` is a special one, which can be omitted when using the
annotation, if it is the only attribute specified, as e.g. in `@CheckCase(CaseMode.UPPER)`.

In addition, the constraint annotation is decorated with a couple of meta annotations:

* `@Target({ FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, ANNOTATION_TYPE, TYPE_USE})`: Defines the supported target
element types for the constraint. `@CheckCase` may be used on fields (element type `FIELD`), JavaBeans properties
as well as method return values (`METHOD`), method/constructor parameters (`PARAMETER`) and type argument of
parameterized types (`TYPE_USE`). The element type `ANNOTATION_TYPE` allows for the creation of composed
constraints (see <<section-constraint-composition>>) based on `@CheckCase`.
+
When creating a class-level constraint (see <<validator-usingvalidator-classlevel>>), the element
type `TYPE` would have to be used. Constraints targeting the return value of a constructor need to
support the element type `CONSTRUCTOR`. Cross-parameter constraints (see
<<section-cross-parameter-constraints>>) which are used to validate all the parameters of a method
or constructor together, must support `METHOD` or `CONSTRUCTOR`, respectively.

* `@Retention(RUNTIME)`: Specifies, that annotations of this type will be available at runtime by the
means of reflection

* `@Constraint(validatedBy = CheckCaseValidator.class)`: Marks the annotation type as constraint
annotation and specifies the validator to be used to validate elements annotated with `@CheckCase`.
If a constraint may be used on several data types, several validators may be specified, one for
each data type.

* `@Documented`: Says, that the use of `@CheckCase` will be contained in the JavaDoc of elements
annotated with it

* `@Repeatable(List.class)`: Indicates that the annotation can be repeated several times at the
same place, usually with a different configuration. `List` is the containing annotation type.

This containing annotation type named `List` is also shown in the example. It allows to specify several
`@CheckCase` annotations on the same element, e.g. with different validation groups and messages.
While another name could be used, the Bean Validation specification recommends to use the name
`List` and make the annotation an inner annotation of the corresponding constraint type.

[[section-constraint-validator]]
==== The constraint validator

Having defined the annotation, you need to create a constraint validator, which is able to validate
elements with a `@CheckCase` annotation. To do so, implement the Bean Validation interface `ConstraintValidator`
as shown below:

[[example-constraint-validator]]
.Implementing a constraint validator for the constraint `@CheckCase`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/CheckCaseValidator.java[tags=include]
----
====

The `ConstraintValidator` interface defines two type parameters which are set in the implementation.
The first one specifies the annotation type to be validated (`CheckCase`), the second one the type of
elements, which the validator can handle (`String`). In case a constraint supports several data types,
a `ConstraintValidator` for each allowed type has to be implemented and registered at the constraint
annotation as shown above.

The implementation of the validator is straightforward. The `initialize()` method gives you access to
the attribute values of the validated constraint and allows you to store them in a field of the
validator as shown in the example.

The `isValid()` method contains the actual validation logic. For `@CheckCase` this is the check whether
a given string is either completely lower case or upper case, depending on the case mode retrieved
in `initialize()`. Note that the Bean Validation specification recommends to consider null values as
being valid. If `null` is not a valid value for an element, it should be annotated with `@NotNull`
explicitly.

===== The `ConstraintValidatorContext`

<<example-constraint-validator>>
relies on the default error message generation by just returning `true` or `false` from the `isValid()`
method. Using the passed `ConstraintValidatorContext` object, it is possible to either add additional
error messages or completely disable the default error message generation and solely define custom
error messages. The `ConstraintValidatorContext` API is modeled as fluent interface and is best
demonstrated with an example:

[[example-constraint-validator-context]]
.Using `ConstraintValidatorContext` to define custom error messages

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/constraintvalidatorcontext/CheckCaseValidator.java[tags=include]
----
====

<<example-constraint-validator-context>>
shows how you can disable the default error message generation and add a custom error message using
a specified message template. In this example the use of the `ConstraintValidatorContext` results in
the same error message as the default error message generation.

[TIP]
====
It is important to add each configured constraint violation by calling `addConstraintViolation()`.
Only after that the new constraint violation will be created.
====

Refer to <<section-custom-property-paths>> to learn how to use the `ConstraintValidatorContext` API to
control the property path of constraint violations for class-level constraints.

[[constraint-validator-hibernateconstraintvalidator]]
===== The `HibernateConstraintValidator` extension

Hibernate Validator provides an extension to the `ConstraintValidator` contract: `HibernateConstraintValidator`.

The purpose of this extension is to provide more contextual information to the `initialize()` method
as, in the current `ConstraintValidator` contract, only the annotation is passed as parameter.

The `initialize()` method of `HibernateConstraintValidator` takes two parameters:

 * The `ConstraintDescriptor` of the constraint at hand.
   You can get access to the annotation using `ConstraintDescriptor#getAnnotation()`.
 * The `HibernateConstraintValidatorInitializationContext` which provides useful helpers and contextual
   information, such as the clock provider, the temporal validation tolerance or the constraint validator payload.

This extension is marked as incubating so it might be subject to change.
The plan is to standardize it and to include it in Bean Validation in the future.

The example below shows how to base your validators on `HibernateConstraintValidator`:

[[example-constraint-validator-hibernateconstraintvalidator]]

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/MyFutureValidator.java[tags=include]
----
====

[WARNING]
====
You should only implement one of the `initialize()` methods. Be aware that both are called when initializing the validator.
====

[[constraint-validator-payload]]
===== Passing a payload to the constraint validator

From time to time, you might want to condition the constraint validator behavior on some external parameters.

For instance, your zip code validator could vary depending on the locale of your application instance if you have one
instance per country.
Another requirement could be to have different behaviors on specific environments: the staging environment may not have
access to some external production resources necessary for the correct functioning of a validator.

The notion of constraint validator payload was introduced for all these use cases.
It is an object passed from the `Validator` instance to each constraint validator via the `HibernateConstraintValidatorInitializationContext`.

The example below shows how to set a constraint validator payload during the `ValidatorFactory` initialization.
Unless you override this default value, all the ``Validator``s created by this `ValidatorFactory` will have this
constraint validator payload value set.

[[example-constraint-validator-payload-definition-validatorfactory]]

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/constraintvalidatorpayload/ConstraintValidatorPayloadTest.java[tags=setConstraintValidatorPayloadDuringValidatorFactoryInitialization]
----

Another option is to set the constraint validator payload per `Validator` using a context:

[[example-constraint-validator-payload-definition-validatorcontext]]
.Defining a constraint validator payload using a `Validator` context
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/constraintvalidatorpayload/ConstraintValidatorPayloadTest.java[tags=setConstraintValidatorPayloadInValidatorContext]
----
====

Once you have set the constraint validator payload, it is time to use it in your constraint validators as shown in the example below:

[[example-constraint-validator-payload-usage]]
.Using the constraint validator payload in a constraint validator
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/constraintvalidatorpayload/ZipCodeValidator.java[tags=include]
----
====

`HibernateConstraintValidatorInitializationContext#getConstraintValidatorPayload()` has a type parameter
and returns the payload only if the payload is of the given type.

[NOTE]
====
It is important to note that the constraint validator payload is different from the dynamic payload you can include in
the constraint violation raised.

The whole purpose of this constraint validator payload is to be used to condition the behavior of your constraint validators.
It is not included in the constraint violations, unless a specific `ConstraintValidator` implementation passes on the
payload to emitted constraint violations by using the <<section-dynamic-payload,constraint violation dynamic payload mechanism>>.
====

[[validator-customconstraints-errormessage]]
==== The error message

The last missing building block is an error message which should be used in case a `@CheckCase`
constraint is violated. To define this, create a file _ValidationMessages.properties_ with the
following contents (see also <<section-message-interpolation>>):

.Defining a custom error message for the `CheckCase` constraint
====
----
org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter06.CheckCase.message=Case mode must be {value}.
----
====

If a validation error occurs, the validation runtime will use the default value, that you specified
for the message attribute of the `@CheckCase` annotation to look up the error message in this resource
bundle.

[[validator-customconstraints-using]]
==== Using the constraint

You can now use the constraint in the `Car` class from the <<validator-gettingstarted>> chapter to
specify that the `licensePlate` field should only contain upper-case strings:

[[example-car-with-checkcase]]
.Applying the `@CheckCase` constraint
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/Car.java[tags=include]
----
====

Finally, <<example-using-checkcase>> demonstrates how validating a `Car` instance with an invalid
license plate causes the `@CheckCase` constraint to be violated.

[[example-using-checkcase]]

----
====

[[section-class-level-constraints]]
=== Class-level constraints

As discussed earlier, constraints can also be applied on the class level to validate the state of an
entire object. Class-level constraints are defined in the same way as are property constraints.
<<example-implementing-classlevel-constraint>> shows constraint annotation and validator of the
`@ValidPassengerCount` constraint you already saw in use in <<example-class-level>>.

[[example-implementing-classlevel-constraint]]

----

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/classlevel/ValidPassengerCountValidator.java[tags=include]
----
====

As the example demonstrates, you need to use the element type `TYPE` in the `@Target` annotation. This
allows the constraint to be put on type definitions. The validator of the constraint in the example
receives a `Car` in the `isValid()` method and can access the complete object state to decide whether
the given instance is valid or not.

[[section-custom-property-paths]]
==== Custom property paths

By default the constraint violation for a class-level constraint is reported on the level of the
annotated type, e.g. `Car`.

In some cases it is preferable though that the violation's property path refers to one of the
involved properties. For instance you might want to report the `@ValidPassengerCount` constraint
against the passengers property instead of the `Car` bean.

<<example-custom-error>>
shows how this can be done by using the constraint validator context passed to `isValid()` to build a
custom constraint violation with a property node for the property passengers. Note that you also
could add several property nodes, pointing to a sub-entity of the validated bean.

[[section-cross-parameter-constraints]]
=== Cross-parameter constraints

Bean Validation distinguishes between two different kinds of constraints.

Generic constraints (which have been discussed so far) apply to the annotated element, e.g. a type,
field, container element, method parameter or return value etc.
Cross-parameter constraints, in contrast, apply to the array of parameters of a method or constructor
and can be used to express validation logic which depends on several parameter values.

In order to define a cross-parameter constraint, its validator class must be annotated with
`@SupportedValidationTarget(ValidationTarget.PARAMETERS)`. The type parameter `T` from the
`ConstraintValidator` interface must resolve to either `Object` or `Object[]` in order to receive the
array of method/constructor arguments in the `isValid()` method.

The following example shows the definition of a cross-parameter constraint which can be used to
check that two `Date` parameters of a method are in the correct order:

.Cross-parameter constraint
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/crossparameter/ConsistentDateParameters.java[tags=include]
----
====

The definition of a cross-parameter constraint isn't any different from defining a generic
constraint, i.e. it must specify the members `message()`, `groups()` and `payload()` and be annotated with
`@Constraint`. This meta annotation also specifies the corresponding validator, which is shown in
<<example-cross-parameter-validator>>. Note that besides the element types `METHOD` and `CONSTRUCTOR`
also `ANNOTATION_TYPE` is specified as target of the annotation, in order to enable the creation of
composed constraints based on `@ConsistentDateParameters` (see
<<section-constraint-composition>>).

[NOTE]
====
Cross-parameter constraints are specified directly on the declaration of a method or constructor,
which is also the case for return value constraints. In order to improve code readability, it is
therefore recommended to choose constraint names - such as `@ConsistentDateParameters` - which make the
constraint target apparent.
====

[[example-cross-parameter-validator]]
.Generic and cross-parameter constraint
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/crossparameter/ConsistentDateParametersValidator.java[tags=include]
----
====

As discussed above, the validation target `PARAMETERS` must be configured for a cross-parameter
validator by using the `@SupportedValidationTarget` annotation. Since a cross-parameter constraint
could be applied to any method or constructor, it is considered a best practice to check for the
expected number and types of parameters in the validator implementation.

As with generic constraints, `null` parameters should be considered valid and `@NotNull` on the
individual parameters should be used to make sure that parameters are not `null`.

[TIP]
====
Similar to class-level constraints, you can create custom constraint violations on single parameters
instead of all parameters when validating a cross-parameter constraint. Just obtain a node builder
from the `ConstraintValidatorContext` passed to `isValid()` and add a parameter node by calling
`addParameterNode()`. In the example you could use this to create a constraint violation on the end
date parameter of the validated method.
====

In rare situations a constraint is both, generic and cross-parameter. This is the case if a
constraint has a validator class which is annotated with
`@SupportedValidationTarget({ValidationTarget.PARAMETERS, ValidationTarget.ANNOTATED_ELEMENT})` or if
it has a generic and a cross-parameter validator class.

When declaring such a constraint on a method which has parameters and also a return value, the
intended constraint target can't be determined. Constraints which are generic and cross-parameter at
the same time must therefore define a member `validationAppliesTo()` which allows the constraint user
to specify the constraint's target as shown in <<example-dual-cross-parameter-constraint>>.

.Generic and cross-parameter constraint

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/crossparameter/ScriptAssert.java[tags=include]
----
====

The `@ScriptAssert` constraint has two validators (not shown), a generic and a cross-parameter one and
thus defines the member `validationAppliesTo()`. The default value `IMPLICIT` allows to derive the
target automatically in situations where this is possible (e.g. if the constraint is declared on a
field or on a method which has parameters but no return value).

If the target can not be determined implicitly, it must be set by the user to either `PARAMETERS` or
`RETURN_VALUE` as shown in <<example-dual-cross-parameter-constraint-usage>>.

[[section-constraint-composition]]
=== Constraint composition

Looking at the `licensePlate` field of the `Car` class in <<example-car-with-checkcase>>, you see three
constraint annotations already. In more complex scenarios, where even more constraints could be applied
to one element, this might easily become a bit confusing. Furthermore, if there was a `licensePlate`
field in another class, you would have to copy all constraint declarations to the other class as
well, violating the DRY principle.

You can address this kind of problem by creating higher level constraints, composed from several
basic constraints. <<example-composed-constraint>> shows a composed constraint annotation which
comprises the constraints `@NotNull`, `@Size` and `@CheckCase`:

[[example-composed-constraint]]
.Creating a composing constraint `@ValidLicensePlate`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/validator/referenceguide/chapter06/constraintcomposition/ValidLicensePlate.java[tags=include]
----
====

To create a composed constraint, simply annotate the constraint declaration with its comprising
constraints. If the composed constraint itself requires a validator, this validator is to be
specified within the `@Constraint` annotation. For composed constraints which don't need an additional
validator such as `@ValidLicensePlate`, just set `validatedBy()` to an empty array.

Using the new composed constraint at the `licensePlate` field is fully equivalent to the previous
version, where the three constraints were declared directly at the field itself:

The set of ``ConstraintViolation``s retrieved when validating a `Car` instance will contain an entry for
each violated composing constraint of the `@ValidLicensePlate` constraint. If you rather prefer a

`@ReportAsSingleViolation` meta constraint can be used as follows:
