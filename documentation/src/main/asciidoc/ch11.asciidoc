[[validator-specifics]]
== Hibernate Validator Specifics

In this chapter you will learn how to make use of several features provided by Hibernate Validator
in addition to the functionality defined by the Bean Validation specification. This includes the
fail fast mode, the API for programmatic constraint configuration and the boolean composition of
constraints.

[NOTE]
====
Using the features described in the following sections may result in application code which is not
portable between Bean Validation providers.
====

=== Public API

Let's start, however, with a look at the public API of Hibernate Validator. <<validator-public-api>>
lists all packages belonging to this API and describes their purpose. Note that when a package is
part of the public this is not necessarily true for its sub-packages.

[[validator-public-api]]

|===============
|Packages|Description
|org.hibernate.validator|Classes used by the Bean Validation bootstrap mechanism
            (eg. validation provider, configuration class); For more details
            see <<chapter-bootstrapping>>.
|org.hibernate.validator.cfg,
            org.hibernate.validator.cfg.context,
            org.hibernate.validator.cfg.defs|Hibernate Validator's fluent API for constraint
            declaration; In org.hibernate.validator.cfg you
            will find the ConstraintMapping interface
            and in org.hibernate.validator.cfg.defs all
            constraint definitions. Refer to <<section-programmatic-api>> for the details.
|org.hibernate.validator.constraints,
            org.hibernate.validator.constraints.br|Some useful custom constraints provided by Hibernate
            Validator in addition to the built-in constraints defined by the
            Bean Validation specification; The constraints are described in
            detail in <<validator-defineconstraints-hv-constraints>>.
|org.hibernate.validator.constraintvalidation|Extended constraint validator context which allows to set
            custom attributes for message interpolation. <<section-hibernateconstraintvalidatorcontext>> describes
            how to make use of that feature.
|org.hibernate.validator.group,
            org.hibernate.validator.spi.group|The group sequence provider feature which allows you to
            define dynamic default group sequences in function of the
            validated object state; The specifics can be found in <<section-default-group-class>>.
|org.hibernate.validator.messageinterpolation,
            org.hibernate.validator.resourceloading,
            org.hibernate.validator.spi.resourceloading|Classes related to constraint message interpolation; The
            first package contains Hibernate Validator's default message
            interpolator,
            ResourceBundleMessageInterpolator. The
            latter two packages provide the
            ResourceBundleLocator SPI for the loading of resource
            bundles (see <<section-resource-bundle-locator>>)
            and its default implementation.

|org.hibernate.validator.valuehandling,
            org.hibernate.validator.spi.valuehandling|Classes related to the processing of values prior to their
            validation, see <<section-value-handling>>.

|===============

[NOTE]
====
The public packages of Hibernate Validator fall into two categories: while the actual API parts are
intended to be _invoked_ or _used_ by clients (e.g. the API for programmatic constraint declaration
or the custom constraints), the SPI (service provider interface) packages contain interfaces which
are intended to be _implemented_ by clients (e.g. ResourceBundleLocator).
====

Any packages not listed in that table are internal packages of Hibernate Validator and are not
intended to be accessed by clients. The contents of these internal packages can change from release
to release without notice, thus possibly breaking any client code relying on it.

[[section-fail-fast]]
=== Fail fast mode

Using the fail fast mode, Hibernate Validator allows to return from the current validation as soon
as the first constraint violation occurs. This can be useful for the validation of large object
graphs where you are only interested in a quick check whether there is any constraint violation at
all.

<<example-using-fail-fast>> shows how to bootstrap and use a fail fast enabled validator.

[[example-using-fail-fast]]
.Using the fail fast validation mode
====
[source, JAVA]
----
package org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter11.failfast;

public class Car {

	@NotNull
	private String manufacturer;

	@AssertTrue
	private boolean isRegistered;

	public Car(String manufacturer, boolean isRegistered) {
		this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
		this.isRegistered = isRegistered;
	}

	//getters and setters...
}
----

[source, JAVA]
----
Validator validator = Validation.byProvider( HibernateValidator.class )
		.configure()
		.failFast( true )
		.buildValidatorFactory()
		.getValidator();

Car car = new Car( null, false );

Set<ConstraintViolation<Car>> constraintViolations = validator.validate( car );

assertEquals( 1, constraintViolations.size() );
----
====

Here the validated object actually fails to satisfy both the constraints declared on the Car class,
yet the validation call yields only one ConstraintViolation since the fail fast mode is enabled.


[NOTE]
====
There is no guarantee in which order the constraints are evaluated, i.e. it is not deterministic
whether the returned violation originates from the @NotNull or the @AssertTrue constraint. If
required, a deterministic evaluation order can be enforced using group sequences as described in
<<section-defining-group-sequences>>.
====

Refer to <<section-provider-specific-settings>> to learn about the different ways of enabling the
fail fast mode when bootstrapping a validator.

[[section-programmatic-api]]
=== Programmatic constraint declaration

As per the Bean Validation specification, you can declare constraints using Java annotations and XML
based constraint mappings.

In addition, Hibernate Validator provides a fluent API which allows for the programmatic
configuration of constraints. Use cases include the dynamic addition of constraints at runtime
depending on some application state or tests where you need entities with different constraints in
different scenarios but don't want to implement actual Java classes for each test case.

By default, constraints added via the fluent API are additive to constraints configured via the
standard configuration capabilities. But it is also possible to ignore annotation and XML configured
constraints where required.

The API is centered around the ConstraintMapping interface. You obtain a new mapping via
HibernateValidatorConfiguration#createConstraintMapping() which you then can configure in a fluent
manner as shown in <<example-constraint-mapping>>.

[[example-constraint-mapping]]
.Programmatic constraint declaration
====
[source, JAVA]
----
HibernateValidatorConfiguration configuration = Validation
		.byProvider( HibernateValidator.class )
		.configure();

ConstraintMapping constraintMapping = configuration.createConstraintMapping();

constraintMapping
	.type( Car.class )
		.property( "manufacturer", FIELD )
			.constraint( new NotNullDef() )
		.property( "licensePlate", FIELD )
			.ignoreAnnotations()
			.constraint( new NotNullDef() )
			.constraint( new SizeDef().min( 2 ).max( 14 ) )
	.type( RentalCar.class )
		.property( "rentalStation", METHOD )
			.constraint( new NotNullDef() );

Validator validator = configuration.addMapping( constraintMapping )
		.buildValidatorFactory()
		.getValidator()
----
====

Constraints can be configured on multiple classes and properties using method chaining. The
constraint definition classes NotNullDef and SizeDef are helper classes which allow to configure
constraint parameters in a type-safe fashion. Definition classes exist for all built-in constraints
in the org.hibernate.validator.cfg.defs package. By calling ignoreAnnotations() any constraints
configured via annotations or XML are ignored for the given element.


[NOTE]
====
Each element (type, property, method etc.) may only be configured once within all the constraint
mappings used to set up one validator factory. Otherwise a ValidationException is raised.
====

[NOTE]
====
It is not supported to add constraints to non-overridden supertype properties and methods by
configuring a subtype. Instead you need to configure the supertype in this case.
====

Having configured the mapping, you must add it back to the configuration object from which you then
can obtain a validator factory.

For custom constraints you can either create your own definition classes extending ConstraintDef or
you can use GenericConstraintDef as seen in <<example-generic-constraint-mapping>>.

[[example-generic-constraint-mapping]]
.Programmatic declaration of a custom constraint
====
[source, JAVA]
----
ConstraintMapping constraintMapping = configuration.createConstraintMapping();

constraintMapping
	.type( Car.class )
		.property( "licensePlate", FIELD )
			.constraint( new GenericConstraintDef<CheckCase>( CheckCase.class )
				.param( "value", CaseMode.UPPER )
			);
----
====

By invoking valid() you can mark a member for cascaded validation which is equivalent to annotating
it with @Valid. Configure any group conversions to be applied during cascaded validation using the
convertGroup() method (equivalent to @ConvertGroup). An example can be seen in
<<example-cascading-constraints>>.

[[example-cascading-constraints]]
.Marking a property for cascaded validation
====
[source, JAVA]
----
ConstraintMapping constraintMapping = configuration.createConstraintMapping();

constraintMapping
	.type( Car.class )
		.property( "driver", FIELD )
			.constraint( new NotNullDef() )
			.valid()
			.convertGroup( Default.class ).to( PersonDefault.class )
	.type( Person.class )
		.property( "name", FIELD )
			.constraint( new NotNullDef().groups( PersonDefault.class ) );
----
====

You can not only configure bean constraints using the fluent API but also method and constructor
constraints. As shown in <<example-method-constraint-mapping>> constructors are identified by their
parameter types and methods by their name and parameter types. Having selected a method or
constructor, you can mark its parameters and/or return value for cascaded validation and add
constraints as well as cross-parameter constraints.

[[example-method-constraint-mapping]]
.Programmatic declaration of method and constructor constraints
====
[source, JAVA]
----
ConstraintMapping constraintMapping = configuration.createConstraintMapping();

constraintMapping
	.type( Car.class )
		.constructor( String.class )
			.parameter( 0 )
				.constraint( new SizeDef().min( 3 ).max( 50 ) )
			.returnValue()
				.valid()
		.method( "drive", int.class )
			.parameter( 0 )
				.constraint( new MaxDef().value ( 75 ) )
		.method( "load", List.class, List.class )
			.crossParameter()
				.constraint( new GenericConstraintDef<LuggageCountMatchesPassengerCount>(
						LuggageCountMatchesPassengerCount.class ).param(
							"piecesOfLuggagePerPassenger", 2
						)
				)
		.method( "getDriver" )
			.returnValue()
				.constraint( new NotNullDef() )
				.valid();
----
====

Last but not least you can configure the default group sequence or the default group sequence
provider of a type as shown in the following example.

[[example-sequences]]
.Configuration of default group sequence and default group sequence provider
====
[source, JAVA]
----
ConstraintMapping constraintMapping = configuration.createConstraintMapping();

constraintMapping
	.type( Car.class )
		.defaultGroupSequence( Car.class, CarChecks.class )
	.type( RentalCar.class )
		.defaultGroupSequenceProviderClass( RentalCarGroupSequenceProvider.class );
----
====

[[section-boolean-constraint-composition]]
=== Boolean composition of constraints

Bean Validation specifies that the constraints of a composed constraint (see
<<section-constraint-composition>>) are all combined via a logical _AND_. This means all of the
composing constraints need to return true in order for an overall successful validation.

Hibernate Validator offers an extension to this and allows you to compose constraints via a logical
_OR_ or _NOT_. To do so you have to use the ConstraintComposition annotation and the enum
CompositionType with its values _AND_, _OR_ and _$$ALL_FALSE$$_.

<<example-boolean-constraint-composition>> shows how to build a composed constraint @PatternOrSize
where only one of the composing constraints needs to be valid in order to pass the validation.
Either the validated string is all lower-cased or it is between two and three characters long.

[[example-boolean-constraint-composition]]
.OR composition of constraints
====
[source, JAVA]
----
package org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter11.booleancomposition;

@ConstraintComposition(OR)
@Pattern(regexp = "[a-z]")
@Size(min = 2, max = 3)
@ReportAsSingleViolation
@Target({ METHOD, FIELD })
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Constraint(validatedBy = { })
public @interface PatternOrSize {
	String message() default "{org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter11." +
			"booleancomposition.PatternOrSize.message}";

	Class<?>[] groups() default { };

	Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default { };
}
----
====

[TIP]
====
Using _$$ALL_FALSE$$_ as composition type implicitly enforces that only a single violation will get
reported in case validation of the constraint composition fails.
====

[[non-el-message-interpolator]]
=== ParameterMessageInterpolator

Hibernate Validator requires per default an implementation of the Unified EL (see
<<validator-gettingstarted-uel>>) to be available. This is needed to allow the interpolation
of constraint error messages using EL expressions as defined by Bean Validation 1.1.

For environments where you cannot or do not want to provide an EL implementation, Hibernate Validators
offers a non EL based message interpolator - +org.hibernate.validator.messageinterpolation.ParameterMessageInterpolator+.

Refer to <<section-custom-message-interpolation>> to see how to plug in custom message interpolator
implementations.

[WARNING]
====
Constraint messages containing EL expressions will be returned un-interpolated by
+org.hibernate.validator.messageinterpolation.ParameterMessageInterpolator+. This also affects
built-in default constraint messages which use EL expressions. At the moment +DecimalMin+ and +DecimalMax+ are affected.
====

=== ResourceBundleLocator

With +ResourceBundleLocator+, Hibernate Validator provides an additional SPI which allows to retrieve
error messages from other resource bundles than _ValidationMessages_ while still using the actual
interpolation algorithm as defined by the specification. Refer to
<<section-resource-bundle-locator>> to learn how to make use of that SPI.

=== Custom contexts

The Bean Validation specification offers at several points in its API the possibility to unwrap a
given interface to a implementor specific subtype. In the case of constraint violation creation in
+ConstraintValidator+ implementations as well as message interpolation in +MessageInterpolator+
instances, there exist unwrap() methods for the provided context instances -
ConstraintValidatorContext respectively MessageInterpolatorContext. Hibernate Validator provides
custom extensions for both of these interfaces.

[[section-hibernateconstraintvalidatorcontext]]
==== HibernateConstraintValidatorContext

[[section-custom-constraint-validator-context]]
HibernateConstraintValidatorContext is a subtype of ConstraintValidatorContext which allows you to
set arbitrary parameters for interpolation via the Expression Language message interpolation
facility (see <<section-interpolation-with-message-expressions>>). For example the default error
message for the @Future constraint is "must be in the future". What if you would like to include the
current date to make the message more explicit? <<example-custom-message-parameter>> shows how this
could be achieved.

[[example-custom-message-parameter]]
.Custom @Future validator with message parameters
====
[source, JAVA]
----
public class MyFutureValidator implements ConstraintValidator<Future, Date> {

	public void initialize(Future constraintAnnotation) {
	}

	public boolean isValid(Date value, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
		Date now = GregorianCalendar.getInstance().getTime();

		if ( value.before( now ) ) {
			HibernateConstraintValidatorContext hibernateContext =
					context.unwrap( HibernateConstraintValidatorContext.class );

			hibernateContext.disableDefaultConstraintViolation();
			hibernateContext.addExpressionVariable( "now", now )
					.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate( "Must be after ${now}" )
					.addConstraintViolation();

			return false;
		}

		return true;
	}
}
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Note that the parameters specified via addExpressionVariable(String, Object) are global and apply
for all constraint violations created by this isValid() invocation. This includes the default
constraint violation, but also all violations created by the ConstraintViolationBuilder. You can,
however, update the parameters between invocations of
ConstraintViolationBuilder#addConstraintViolation().
====

[WARNING]
====
This functionality is currently experimental and might change in future versions.
====

==== HibernateMessageInterpolatorContext

Hibernate Validator also offers a custom extension of MessageInterpolatorContext, namely
HibernateMessageInterpolatorContext (see <<example-custom-message-interpolator-context>>). This
subtype was introduced to allow a better integration of Hibernate Validator into the Glassfish. The
root bean type was in this case needed to determine the right classloader for the message resource
bundle. If you have any other usecases, let us know.

[[example-custom-message-interpolator-context]]
.HibernateMessageInterpolatorContext
====
[source, JAVA]
----
public interface HibernateMessageInterpolatorContext extends MessageInterpolator.Context {

	/**
	 * Returns the currently validated root bean type.
	 *
	 * @return The currently validated root bean type.
	 */
	Class<?> getRootBeanType();
}
----
====

[[section-paranamer-parameternameprovider]]
=== ParaNamer based ParameterNameProvider

Hibernate Validator comes with a ParameterNameProvider implementation which leverages the
link:http://paranamer.codehaus.org/[ParaNamer] library.

This library provides several ways for obtaining parameter names at runtime, e.g. based on debug
symbols created by the Java compiler, constants with the parameter names woven into the bytecode in
a post-compile step or annotations such as the @Named annotation from JSR 330.

In order to use ParanamerParameterNameProvider, either pass an instance when bootstrapping a
validator as shown in <<example-using-custom-parameter-name-provider>> or specify
org.hibernate.validator.parameternameprovider.ParanamerParameterNameProvider as value for the
&lt;parameter-name-provider&gt; element in the _META-INF/validation.xml_ file.


[TIP]
====
When using this parameter name provider, you need to add the ParaNamer library to your classpath. It
is available in the Maven Central repository with the group id +com.thoughtworks.paranamer+ and the
artifact id +paranamer+.
====

By default ParanamerParameterNameProvider retrieves parameter names from constants added to the byte
code at build time (via DefaultParanamer) and debug symbols (via BytecodeReadingParanamer).
Alternatively you can specify a Paranamer implementation of your choice when creating a
ParanamerParameterNameProvider instance.

[[section-value-handling]]
=== Unwrapping values

Sometimes it is required to unwrap values prior to validating them. For example, in
<<example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue>> a link:http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/[JavaFX] property type
is used to define an element of a domain model. The +@Size+ constraint is meant to be applied to the
string value not the wrapping +Property+ instance.

[[example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue]]
.Applying a constraint to wrapped value of a JavaFX property
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Size(min = 3)
private Property<String> name = new SimpleStringProperty( "Bob" );
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The concept of value unwrapping is considered experimental at this time and may evolve into more
general means of value handling in future releases. Please let us know about your use cases for such
functionality.
====

Bean properties in JavaFX are typically not of simple data types like +String+ or +int+, but are
wrapped in +Property+ types which allows to make them observable, use them for data binding etc. When
applying a constraint such as +@Size+ to an element of type +Property<String>+ without further
preparation, an exception would be raised, indicating that no suitable validator for that constraint
and data type can be found. Thus the validated value must be unwrapped from the containing property
object before looking up a validator and invoking it.

For unwrapping to occur a +ValidatedValueUnwrapper+ needs to be registered for the type
requiring unwrapping. Example <<example-implementation-of-validatedvalueunwrapper>> shows how this
schematically looks for a JavaFX +PropertyValueUnwrapper+. You just need to extend the SPI class
+ValidatedValueUnwrapper+ and implement its abstract methods.

[[example-implementation-of-validatedvalueunwrapper]]
.Implementing the ValidatedValueUnwrapper interface
====
[source, JAVA]
----
public class PropertyValueUnwrapper extends ValidatedValueUnwrapper<Property<?>> {

	@Override
	public Object handleValidatedValue(Property<?> value) {
		//...
	}

	@Override
	public Type getValidatedValueType(Type valueType) {
		//...
	}
}
----
====

The +ValidatedValueUnwrapper+ needs also to be registered with the +ValidatorFactory+:

[[example-registering-validatedvalueunwrapper]]
.Registering a ValidatedValueUnwrapper
====
[source, JAVA]
----
Validator validator = Validation.byProvider( HibernateValidator.class )
		.configure()
		.addValidatedValueHandler( new PropertyValueUnwrapper() )
		.buildValidatorFactory()
		.getValidator();
----
====

Several unwrapper implementations can be registered. During constraint validator resolution
Hibernate Validator automatically checks whether a +ValidatedValueUnwrapper+ exists for the validated
value. If so, unwrapping occurs automatically. In some cases, however, constraint validator instances
for a given constraint might exist for the wrapper as well as the wrapped value (+@NotNull+ for example
applies to all objects). In this case Hibernate Validator needs to be explicitly told which value
to validate. This can be done via +@UnwrapValidatedValue(true)+ respectively
+@UnwrapValidatedValue(false)+.

[NOTE]
====
Note that it is not specified which of the unwrapper implementations is
chosen when more than one implementation is suitable to unwrap a given element.
====

Instead of programmatically registering +ValidatedValueUnwrapper+ types, the fully-qualified names
of one ore more unwrapper implementations can be specified
via the configuration property +hibernate.validator.validated_value_handlers+ which can be useful when
configuring the default validator factory using the descriptor _META-INF/validation.xml_ (see
<<chapter-xml-configuration>>).

[[section-optional-unwrapper]]
==== Optional unwrapper

Hibernate Validator provides built-in unwrapping for +Optional+ introduced in Java 8.
The unwrapper is registered automatically in Java 8 environments, and no further configuration is
required. An example of unwrapping an +Optional+ instance is shown in
<<example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue-and-optional>>.

[[example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue-and-optional]]
.Unwrapping +Optional+ instances
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Size(min = 3)
private Optional<String> firstName = Optional.of( "John" );

@NotNull
@UnwrapValidatedValue // UnwrapValidatedValue required since otherwise unclear which value to validate
private Optional<String> lastName = Optional.of( "Doe" );
----
====

[NOTE]
====
+Optional.empty()+ is treated as +null+ during validation. This means that for constraints where
+null+ is considered valid, +Optional.empty()+ is similarly valid.
====

[[section-javafx-unwrapper]]
==== JavaFX unwrapper

Hibernate Validator also provides built-in unwrapping for JavaFX property values. The unwrapper is
registered automatically for environments where JavaFX is present, and no further configuration is
required. +ObservableValue+ and its sub-types are supported.
An example of some of the different ways in which +JavaFX+ property values can be unwrapped is
shown in <<example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue-and-javafx>>.

[[example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue-and-javafx]]
.Unwrapping +JavaFX+ properties
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Min(value = 3)
IntegerProperty integerProperty1 = new SimpleIntegerProperty( 4 );

@Min(value = 3)
Property<Number> integerProperty2 = new SimpleIntegerProperty( 4 );

@Min(value = 3)
ObservableValue<Number> integerProperty3 = new SimpleIntegerProperty( 4 );
----
====

==== Unwrapping object graphs

Unwrapping can also be used with object graphs (cascaded validation) as shown in
<<example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue-and-optional-with-valid>>.
When validating the object holding the +Optional<Person>+, a cascaded validation of the +Person+
object would be performed.

[[example-using-unwrapvalidatedvalue-and-optional-with-valid]]
.Unwrapping +Optional+ prior to cascaded validation via +@Valid+
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@Valid
private Optional<Person> person = Optional.of( new Person() );
----
[source, JAVA]
----
public class Person {
	@Size(min =3)
	private String name = "Bob";
}
----
====

[[section-constraint-definition-contribution]]
=== Providing constraint definitions

Bean Validation allows to (re-)define constraint definitions via XML in its constraint mapping
files. See <<section-mapping-xml-constraints>> for more information and <<example-constraints-car>>
for an example. While this approach is sufficient for many use cases,  it has it shortcomings
in others. Imagine for example a constraint library wanting to contribute constraint
definitions for custom types. This library could provide a mapping file with their library, but this
file still would need to be referenced by the user of the library. Luckily there are better ways.

[NOTE]
====
The following concepts are considered experimental at this time. Let us know whether you find them
useful and whether they meet your needs.
====

==== Constraint definitions via +ServiceLoader+

Hibernate Validator allows to utilize Java's
link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html/[ServiceLoader]
mechanism to register additional constraint definitions. All you have to do is to add the file
_javax.validation.ConstraintValidator_ to _META-INF/services_. In this service file you list the
fully qualified classnames of your constraint validator classes (one per line). Hibernate Validator
will automatically infer the constraint types they apply to.
See <<example-using-service-file-for-constraint-definitions,Constraint definition via service file>>
for an example.

[[example-using-service-file-for-constraint-definitions]]
._META-INF/services/javax.validation.ConstraintValidator_

====
[source]
----
# Assuming a custom constraint annotation @org.mycompany.CheckCase
org.mycompany.CheckCaseValidator
----
====

To contribute default messages for your custom constraints, place a ContributorValidationMessages.properties_
and/or its locale-specific specializations at the root your jar.

[[section-constraint-definition-contributor]]
==== Constraint definitions via +ConstraintDefinitionContributor+

While the service loader approach works in many scenarios, but not in all (think for example
OSGi where service files are not visible), there is yet another way of contributing constraint
definitions. You can provide one or more implementations of +ConstraintDefinitionContributor+ to
+HibernateConfiguration+ during bootstrapping of the +ValidatorFactory+ - see
<<example-using-constraint-definition-contributor>>.

[[example-using-constraint-definition-contributor]]
.Using +ConstraintDefinitionContributor+ to register constraint definitions
====
[source, JAVA]
----
public class CarTest {

	private static Validator validator;

	public static class MyConstraintDefinitionContributor
			implements ConstraintDefinitionContributor {

		@Override
		public void collectConstraintDefinitions(ConstraintDefinitionBuilder builder) {
			builder.constraint( ValidPassengerCount.class )
					.validatedBy( ValidPassengerCountValidator.class );
		}
	}

	@BeforeClass
	public static void setUpValidator() {

		HibernateValidatorConfiguration configuration = Validation
				.byProvider( HibernateValidator.class )
				.configure();

		ConstraintDefinitionContributor contributor = new MyConstraintDefinitionContributor();
		configuration.addConstraintDefinitionContributor( contributor );

		validator = configuration.buildValidatorFactory().getValidator();
	}

    // ...
}
----
====

Instead of programmatically registering +ConstraintDefinitionContributor+ instances, the
fully-qualified classnames of one or more implementations can be specified via the
property +hibernate.validator.constraint_definition_contributors+. This can be useful when
configuring the default validator factory using _META-INF/validation.xml_ (see
<<chapter-xml-configuration>>).

[TIP]
====
One use case for +ConstraintDefinitionContributor+ is the ability to specify an alternative
constraint validator for the +@URL+ constraint. Historically, Hibernate Validator's default constraint
validator for this constraint uses the +java.net.URL+ constructor to validate an URL.
However, there is also a purely regular expression based version available which can be configured using
a +ConstraintDefinitionContributor+:

.Using a +ConstraintDefinitionContributor+ to register a regular expression based constraint definition for +@URL+
[source, JAVA]
----
HibernateValidatorConfiguration configuration = Validation
	.byProvider( HibernateValidator.class )
	.configure();

configuration.addConstraintDefinitionContributor(
	new ConstraintDefinitionContributor() {
		@Override
		public void collectConstraintDefinitions(ConstraintDefinitionBuilder builder) {
			builder.constraint( URL.class )
				.includeExistingValidators( false )
				.validatedBy( RegexpURLValidator.class );
		}
	}
);
----
====

[[section-constraint-customizing-class-loading]]
=== Customizing class-loading

There are several cases in which Hibernate Validator needs to load resources or classes given by name:

* XML descriptors (+META-INF/validation.xml+ as well as XML constraint mappings)
* classes specified by name in XML descriptors (e.g. custom message interpolators etc.)
* the +ValidationMessages+ resource bundle

By default Hibernate Validator tries to load these resources via the current thread context classloader.
If that's not successful, Hibernate Validator's own classloader will be tried as a fallback.

For cases where this strategy is not appropriate (e.g. modularized environments such as OSGi),
you may provide a specific classloader for loading these resources when bootstrapping the validator factory:

[[example-using-external-class-loader]]
.Providing a classloader for loading external resources and classes
====
[source, JAVA]
----
ClassLoader classLoader = ...;

Validator validator = Validation.byProvider( HibernateValidator.class )
		.configure()
		.externalClassLoader( classLoader )
		.buildValidatorFactory()
		.getValidator();
----
====

In the case of OSGi, you could e.g. pass the loader of a class from the bundle bootstrapping Hibernate Validator
or a custom classloader implementation which delegates to +Bundle#loadClass()+ etc.

[NOTE]
====
Call +ValidatorFactory#close()+ if a given validator factory instance is not needed any longer.
Failure to do so may result in a classloader leak in cases where applications/bundles are re-deployed and a non-closed
validator factory still is referenced by application code.
