== `PropertyNodeNameProvider` improvements

We've identified that in some scenarios, e.g., with the recent Jackson 3 changes,
it might be useful to have access to additional information when trying to
construct the property node name. For these reasons, `PropertyNodeNameProvider` now
comes with the `getName(Property property, PropertyNodeNameProviderContext context)`.
`PropertyNodeNameProviderContext` opens up access to the current getter name strategy.

At the same time `org.hibernate.validator.spi.nodenameprovider.JavaBeanProperty` introduced
an extra `getMemberName()` method. As `JavaBeanProperty` is backed by a field/getter
this method returns the name of such class member.
