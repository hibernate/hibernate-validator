    <para>This release has beta status, which means that this documenation is not yet complete.
    You can find more information about the current state of the implementation on the <ulink
    url="http://www.hibernate.org/459.html">Bean Validation Roadmap</ulink> or
    you can refer to JSR 303 directly for further examples.</para>

    <para>Please report any problems or bugs in either <ulink
    url="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HV">Jira

    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>Validating data is a common task that occurs throughout an
    application, from the presentation layer to the persistence layer. Often
    the same validation logic is implemented in each layer, proving time
    consuming and error-prone. To avoid duplication of these validations in
    each layer, developers often bundle validation logic directly into the
    domain model, cluttering domain classes with validation code that is, in
    fact, metadata about the class itself.</para>

    <para>JSR 303 - Bean Validation - defines a metadata model and API for
    JavaBean validation. The default metadata source is annotations, with the
    ability to override and extend the meta-data through the use of XML
    validation descriptors. The API is not tied to a specific application tier
    or programming model. It is specifically not tied to either the web tier
    or the persistence tier, and is available for both server-side application
    programming, as well as rich client Swing application developers.</para>

    <para>Hibernate Validator is an implementation of this JSR.</para>
