  <title>Further reading</title>

  <para>Last but not least, a few pointers to further information.</para>

  <para>A great source for examples is the Bean Validation TCK which is
  available for anonymous access on <ulink
  url="https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck">GitHub</ulink>.
  In particular the TCK's <ulink
  url="https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck/tree/master/src/main/java/org/hibernate/jsr303/tck/tests">tests</ulink>
  might be of interest. <ulink url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303">The
  JSR 303</ulink> specification itself is also a great way to deepen your
  understanding of Bean Validation resp. Hibernate Validator.</para>

  <para>If you have any further questions to Hibernate Validator or want to
  share some of your use cases have a look at the <ulink
  url="http://community.jboss.org/en/hibernate/validator">Hibernate Validator
  Wiki</ulink> and the <ulink
  url="https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=9">Hibernate Validator
  Forum</ulink>.</para>

  <para>In case you would like to report a bug use <ulink
  url="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HV">Hibernate's
  Jira</ulink> instance. Feedback is always welcome!</para>
