            In order to test with the Hibernate Validator classes bundled in the war file we have to make sure
            that the default org.hibernate.validator module classes are not loaded/used instead.
            System dependencies have precedence - see https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Class+Loading+in+AS7
