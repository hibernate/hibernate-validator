# Hibernate Validator TCK Runner

This maven module allows to run the Bean Validation TCK against Hibernate Validator.
There are several ways of doing this.

## Standalone

You can run the test as normal unit test using a JVM forked by the Surefire plugin. This is the default mode and
used when running

    $ mvn clean test

## In container

You can also run the TCK test against JBoss AS7 (>Beta3). In this case the tests are bundled as war files and executed
in a remote JBoss AS7 instance:

    $ mvn clean test -D incontainer

In this mode the tests will run against the Hibernate Validator version bundled with AS 7 (currently 4.1.0.Final) which
will lead to test errors. You can place the latest Hibernate Validator instance into your AS 7 instance or you can
bundle the Hibernate Validator jar with the deployed war files:

    $ mvn test -Dincontainer -Dbundled-dependencies

Alternatively you can run against the TCK version is in sync with Hibernate Validator 4.1.0.Final:

    $ mvn test -Dincontainer -Djsr303.tck.version=1.0.4.GA
